## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nehagoswami21/nova-assistant.git
cd nova-assistant
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

## 🗣 How to Use
Once Nova starts, it will listen for your voice and try to recognize commands such as:

"hello" — Greeting

"what time is it" — Tells the current time

"play music" — Opens Spotify in your browser

"what's your name" — Replies with its name

"who created you" — Tells about its creator

"goodbye" — Exits the assistant

Talk naturally, and wait for Nova to respond. It listens for 6 seconds by default per input.

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

FFmpeg (required by Whisper)
